      Untoldd was born out of a passion for entrepreneurship and a desire to change the way brands are created. As a team of digital marketing enthusiasts and e-commerce experts, we noticed a growing trend: influencers wanted to do more than just promote products—they wanted to create their own. However, the process of launching a brand was often complex, costly, and time-consuming, especially for those without a background in business.
This realization sparked the idea for Untoldd. We wanted to bridge the gap between creativity and commerce by offering a comprehensive solution that would make brand creation accessible to all influencers, regardless of their size or resources. Our team combined its deep knowledge of e-commerce, product development, and digital marketing to build a platform that takes care of everything from manufacturing to sales, allowing influencers to focus on what truly matters—connecting with their audience and building their personal brand.
Untoldd is more than just a business; it's a movement to empower creators and bring untold stories to life. By partnering with influencers to create unique, high-quality products, we're not just launching brands—we're helping to write the next chapter in the story of influencer commerce.
